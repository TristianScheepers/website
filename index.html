		<h2><strong>Who I Am</strong></h2>

		<p>My name is <b>Tristian Scheepers</b> and I am 17 years old. I am a student at <a href="www.camst.co.za">The Cape Academy of Maths, Science and Technology</a>.</p>

		<p>I started out my high school career at <em>HeathField High</em>, which - don't get me wrong - wasn't the best decission. I did my grade 8-9 their. When I was in 
		grade 8, I thought that the work was too much and we got too many pages of work. so I kind of became a <i>reble</i>. As teenagers, we think that we are soo "grown up" and no one can tell us what we can and can't do or what we must do. So I started not doing my homework, I gave my teachers a hard time, and i would just do what ever I wanted to do.</p>

		<p>I started bunking classes and then school after a while. My class teacher eventually phoned my parents and told them about my bunking of classes, which didn't 
		<b>strike</b> them to well.</p>

		<p>My grade 9 year was one of my best years at school. I made many friends the previous, so now i basically knew everyone on the school. when this happens, you tend to
		do what ever you want because its your second year on the school and you have a lot of friends. My class and i would even bunk our different classes that we got, and then go hide away from the
		teacher and sit or lay on the field. <b><i>Life was all good</i></b></p>

		<p>At the end of grade 9 I got 98% for my final mark in Maths. I told one of my swimming coaches about this and told me <i>"What are doing at HeathField High when you can be at The Cape Academy of Maths, Science and Technology".</i> He is a teacher their, and teaches 
		<a href="learn,mindset.co.za/resources/computer-applications-technology/grade-10">CAT</a> and 
		<a href="jobsearchtech.about.com/od/careersintechnology/p/ITDefinition.htm">IT</a>.</p>
		
		<p>I decided to send in an application form which he gave in for me. The school accepted me for grade 10 - they start at grade 10.My grade 10 year was alright except that my marks weren't as good as what they were at my old high school.</p>

		<p>In the june holidays of 2013, a matriculant girl from my school named Natalie McClean added me on
		<a href="www.facebook/login.com">Facebook</a>.
		We started to get to know eachother a little bit at a time and finally got together in the end.</p>
